            Worst Landlord's Properties in New York City of 2022 According to the Office of the Public Advocate
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            Utilizing data via the Office of the Public Advocate, Jumaane Williams, I collected the address and location
            of the 15 properties owned by the worst landlord in New York City, Jonathan Santana. Santana has nearly
            3,000 open housing violations as of 2022 according to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development
            (HPD). This is the most of any private landlord in the City.
