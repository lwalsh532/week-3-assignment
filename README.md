# week-3-class-new
 I collected data from the Office of the Public Advocate in order to gather the  property addresses owned by the "Worst Landlord in NYC." I gathered all addresses and placed them in a geocoder (GeoCodio) to receive each longitude and latitude.

 I then used the template we used in class to work towards my map. I inputted each long/lat along with the address of the property and the number of HPD violations.

I created buttons so that users could zoom into a section of NYC that Santana owned a significant number of properties. I split it into 4 sections: East Village, Midtown, Washington Heights, parts of Queens. Finally, I added a return home button to take you  back to the main map.

 I changed the buttons and color palette of the map as well. Along with adding text so the user could follow along. Each marker contains the address along with the number of violations each building currently has.
